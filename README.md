Pigeons Utility
==============

A utility for intercommunication between shell and multiple modules in plain AS3. 
For PureMVC users who think that the pipes utility is a bit too complicated, this can be a nice alternative. 
The pigeons utility is not bound to a specific framework and can be used in any AS3 project.
